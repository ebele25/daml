    "of statistical techniques (e.g. silhouette analysis) exist to estimate a good number of clusters,\n",
    "these are far from perfect.\n",
    "Preexisting knowledge of the data,\n",
    "possibly aided by dimensionality reduction is often needed to find a good number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm requires stochastic initialization and,\n",
    "given a bad initial start, may find a local minimum instead of a global minimum.\n",
    "In other words badly initialized k-means can cluster badly.\n",
    "In practice k-means is run for several random initializations and then evaluated.\n",
    "Below the hood this is what the `sklearn` version of k-means does,\n",
    "it runs the model fit several times and selects the best model.\n",
    "(The number of times the k-means algorithm is initialized by `sklearn` is defined\n",
    "by the `n_init=` argument to the class initialization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the distance measure used is linear,\n",
    "k-means is a linear algorithm and will only find clusters defined by linear borders.\n",
    "Graph techniques such as spectral clustering or some versions of hierarchical clustering\n",
    "are capable of dealing directly with non-linear clusters.\n",
    "Yet, another viable trick is to pre-process the data with a manifold technique\n",
    "and then cluster the projected data with (possibly a variant of) k-means."
