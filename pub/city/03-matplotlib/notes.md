## daml-03-01-plotting-basics.ipynb 18:30-18:50

- there's lots of talking to be made about mpl history an clunkiness
- the notebook magic and how the plotting actually happens
- a good focus on the two interfaces (code examples elsewhere may use either)

## daml-03-02-reference.ipynb 18:50-19:05

- this is super boring if one talks about every piece
- just go through making some jokes, students can refer back to it
- the latex primer is important

## daml-03-03-stat-plots.ipynb 19:05-19:30

- make the students think about how many dimensions can be plotted
- when you reach four dimensions explain the iris data and go through it
- leave histograms for after the break

## pause 19:30-19:40

## daml-03-03-stat-plots.ipynb 19:40-20:00

- make sure people understand what a histogram is
- resist from explaining the gaussian process, tell them it will come up later

## daml-03-04-extras.ipynb 20:00-20:10

- do not waste time on this one
- this is really for the curious students to explore extra functionality

## daml-03-05-matplotlib-exercises.ipynb 20:10-20:30

- exercise 3 is particularly difficult, tell students
- remind the randomness bits from the numpy lecture
