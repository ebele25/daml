## daml-06-01-machine-learning.ipynb 18:30-19:00

- stats vs ml is important
- ml does not necessarily needs to understand the problem
- ml types
- parameters vs hyperparameters
- training is about finding the best parameters, and hyperparameters

## daml-06-02-monte-carlo.ipynb 19:00-19:20

- approximate the value of pi using monte carlo
- brute force algorithm
- repetitions or more points are pretty much the same thing

## daml-06-03-sklearn-intro.ipynb 19:30-20:30

- this will generate lots of questions, expect them
- sklearn standardization
- typical X and y in ML, many dimensions
- long explanation of hyperparameters on KNN
- classify some data, how k matters
- what's the best solution then?
- training and test sets
- many ways of evaluating a model
- f1 score, precision and recall
- we have only a single hyperparameter in KNN, often there are more
- there's more: training, testing and validation; next week
