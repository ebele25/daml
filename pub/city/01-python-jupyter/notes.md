## daml-01-01-introduction.ipynb 18:30-18:40

- difference between data analytics and ML
- joke about ML vs engineering (in the notebook)
- history of the libraries

## daml-01-02-resources.ipynb 18:40-18:50

- talk about all the resources at city, notably one drive
- eduroam uses the same login as email
- anaconda, moodle, ipynb
- download the shortcut from moodle (to start jupyter in the U; drive)
- evaluation: python is expected knowledge - today's review is all
- around here we will need to help people with logins and jupyter

## daml-01-03-notebook-basics.ipynb 18:50-18:55

- go very, very quickly through this one
- make the students open the jupyter notebook
- the important bit is that data science requires presentation of results

## daml-01-04-notebook-code.ipynb 18:55-19:10

- say that the python code is executing when you Ctrl-Enter
- talk about the kernel in the background
- restarting the kernel

## daml-01-05-jupyter-exercises-1.ipynb 19:10-19:30

- make sure everyone can execute code
- things should go quite slowly until here
- you can evaluate people's math with the mean vs median problems

## pause 19:30-40

## daml-01-07-pydata-primer.ipynb 19:40-20:00

- this is a python review, containing the pieces that we will use
- everyone should be capable of writing functions
- return values and tuples
- describe the function arguments and optional arguments
- we are not using it too much but is very important to understand the docs
- list comprehensions are similar to dealing with pandas (important!)
- try to make fun of the cat food example
- the final comprehension example is a brain-fuck, make fun of it
- be quick through string operations and data types, people can read it
- do an emphasis on what lambdas are, you can ignore the objects part

## daml-01-08-python-exercises.ipynb 20:00-20:20

- make everyone do all the easy exercises, leave the rest for home
- several exercises are not exactly specified, that's intended
- working with ML, things are hardly ever well specified

## daml-01-10-notebook-magic.ipynb 20:25-20:30

- just say that % is line magic and %% is cell magic
- leave people to read the rest at home
- the debugger will require some extra reading

## daml-01-11-jupyter-exercises-2.ipynb

- to do at home, may be discussed another week
- some of the exercises are only there to play with jupyter
- explain that solutions will be published every Friday
