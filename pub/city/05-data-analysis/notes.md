## daml-05-01-stats-basics.ipynb 18:30-19:10

- talk a little about SciPy, i.e. higher level of maths than NumPy
- draw (on the boards) the idea of degrees of freedom
- i.e. draw a distribution and then perform sampling of it
- go though all trivial statistical measures
- std is meaningful and useful over a normal distribution (important)
- there are lots of other distributions
- central limit theorem, when there are lots of variables it becomes normal
- the above is 70% of why stats and ML became so important recently
- the other reason are the GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems (if there's time)

## daml-05-02-stats-exercises.ipynb 19:10-19:30

- these are very important, do not save time here
- make sure everyone can write an equation with NumPy
- this is the minimal level we want to people get, use more time if needed

## pause 19:30-19:40

## daml-05-04-seaborn.ipynb 19:40-19:50 (preferably jumped)

- can be jumped, not very relevant since matplotlib 2.0 came out
- maybe show the first paragraphs about other libraries for stats (statsmodels)
- otherwise the students can read it and do the exercises by themselves

## daml-05-05-seaborn-exercises.ipynb 19:50-20:00 (preferably jumped))

- still work but aren't particularly good or relevant
- one option is to ask the students if they want seaborn or die hard

## daml-05-07-die-hard.ipynb 20:00-20:30

- this is an answer to, why python got the upper hand in data science
- because it is a full programming language, easy to interface
- it also is a funny demonstration of pandas' power, to boot student morale
