- real world data is messy
- data frame is just a bunch of series together (this is important)
- series has an index
- sorted and implicit index, this becomes inconsistent quickly
- data frame indexing is by column, whilst numpy was by row
- population graph has a logarithmic scale but looks like a straight line, joke
- quick regex primer

## daml-04-02-database-operations.ipynb 19:00-19:30

- if the students look bored do time series first
- stacking and melting reduces dimensions, pivoting increases dimensions
- this means that we can represent any number of dimensions in two dimensions

## daml-04-03-pandas-time-series.ipynb 19:40-20:20

- date parsing can be complex, indexing on dates even more
- crazy offsets in the documentation
- show the fremont bridge on map, it is next to seattle google and adobe
- resampling gets us less cluttered graphs
- data collection started on wednesday and that can be seen from the data
- groupby with aggregation can give us more, e.g. daily routine
- weekday vs weekend uses a multiple index to split the times

## daml-04-04-pandas-exercises.ipynb 20:20-20:30

- tell students that the best way to solve most is with a graph
- they should try to do them in as little lines of code as possible
- exercises 6 and 7 (especially 7) are difficult (will require groupby)
