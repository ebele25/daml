## daml-02-01-numpy-basics.ipynb 18:30-18:50

- be quick about numpy history
- thoroughly explain the array representation in memory
- then do the examples
- and again explain the memory layout when indexing
- be quick about the object attributes
- when doing data types say that they have different sizes in memory

## daml-02-04-numpy-exercises.ipynb 18:50-19:10

- jump over to exercises
- do 1 to 5 now, and try to make them understand how to create arrays
- do not let the exercises take too long, there's lots of ground to cover

## daml-02-02-numpy-operations.ipynb 19:10-19:30

- explain the start, stop, step in python slicing
- one more time go over memory layout
- emphasis on modifying slices (i.e. assignment onto slices)

## pause 19:30-19:40

## daml-02-02-numpy-operations.ipynb 19:40-20:00

- be fast about the other sections (e.g. sorting)
- tell the students that there are exercises about sorting
- quick over ufuncs but very thorough about the axis= argument

## daml-02-03-randomness.ipynb 20:00-20:10

- this notebook exists so that they can make the exercises
- do not talk about matplotlib
- show them the different APIs and the different distributions

## daml-02-06-random-walk.ipynb 20:10-20:30

- make it an example of why array accesses are useful
- accessing different parts of the array accesses different walks
- and clever slices allow us to "query" the array

## daml-02-04-numpy-exercises.ipynb 20:30?

- there may be some time to do the exercises in class but that's unlikely
