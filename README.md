# Description

DAML - Lectures in Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Jupyter notebooks, material, code and data for lectures I give about the
practice (and some theory) of Data Science in Python.  This repository contains
materials that may be presented in a different order, i.e. please do not rely
on the repository naming convention for material ordering.


# Main References

Text, code and examples that are contained within this repository have been
heavily influenced by several other texts.  While for my own lectures on Data
Analytics and Machine Learning I use the (more-or-less) exact material in this
repository, several other materials helped me build it.  No single material in
modern Data Science can be attributed to the effort of a single person,
therefore I want to acknowledge the huge effort made by many researchers,
teachers and presenters that allowed me to summarise this work into the shape
seen in this repository.  The main pieces use by me are:

- [Think Stats, 2nd Edition - by Allen B. Downey][1]
- [Python Data Science Handbook - by Jake VanderPlas][2]
- [Data Analysis with Python and Pandas - by Bill Chambers][3]
- [Intro to Information Retrieval - by Manning, Raghavan and Sch√ºtze][4]
- [Statistics Done Wrong - by Alex Reinhart][5]

These are by no means exhaustive, where a different reference is used, or gives
extra information to the presented material; the reference is placed directly
in the text.

## Data

The Copyright of the data files in this repository is covered by several *Open
Data* initiatives.  Where several different licenses are covered, or similar
to, public domain attribution; whilst others are licensed under very specific
licenses that allow for non-commercial (or academic only) usage.  This
repository uses the data in an academic fashion but, in general, I'd advise
against using this data for any non-academic purpose.

As of this writing the complications about Open Data policies would require me
to track the use of every data provided to each user, which is inviable.
Instead I point to the place from where the data can be retrieved from and
advise that, if you want to use this data you download it from there.
