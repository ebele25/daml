    "\n",
    "Data Science is a kind off a combination of both above.\n",
    "The person performing them is often called a Data Scientist.\n",
    "Typically, one will first try to tackle a difficult problem by data analysis and then,\n",
    "if the problem cannot be solved by data analysis, you attempt machine learning.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying handwritten digits, or text\n",
    "- How many people on twitter are \"positive\" about a hashtag?\n",
    "- Finding the optimal computer network distribution, in an un-optimal world\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, but not always,\n",
    "the difference between the use of plain analysis and machine learning is the scale of the problem.\n",
    "Yet, are there problems that can be solved by data analysis but cannot be solved by machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bus watcher problem: Imagine that one needs to classify bus routes traveling\n",
    "  through the M25 (ring road of London) but all data he can have is from the observation\n",
    "  of a stretch of the road 8h a day.  He may be able to read bus destinations\n",
    "  and transport company logos but logos may be misleading.\n",
    "  Often bus companies exchange routes between themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The bus watcher would need several weeks of data to have a good chance of guessing\n",
    "  routes whilst accounting for vehicle and route exchanges between the bus companies.\n",
    "  Yet, bus companies do not sit idly during this period.\n",
    "  By the time the bus watcher collected his data, the data is out of date.\n",
    "  In summary, the real world problem - the bus schedule - changes its pattern\n",
    "  too fast in order to be captured by the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  One could try to capture the pattern of how the bus companies operate.\n",
    "  But that is a very, very difficult problem,\n",
    "  one can argue that we are attempting to model human behavior\n",
    "  of company contract changes.\n",
    "  This new problem is not only overly difficult but also has nothing to do\n",
    "  with the original problem of attempting to find the bus schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, these kinds of problems are often not performed by a data scientist.\n",
    "Or at least, a clever data scientist recognizes when he is asked to\n",
    "work on a problem that changes too fast because of meddling people\n",
    "(or other highly complex system).\n",
    "In theory, such a complex problem (human behavior in setting contracts)\n",
    "can be solved if one has enough data;\n",
    "yet, the amount of data and computation needed would be overwhelming.\n",
    "Knowing a solvable problem from an unsolvable one,\n",

    "1.  **Jupyter (and Python Review)**:\n",
    "    We will explore *Jupyter*, a data science platform using the Python\n",
    "    programming language.\n",
    "    Along the way we will go through a quick review of Python,\n",
    "    yet we will not learn how to program - it is expected that one\n",
    "    knows how to program in order to benefit from the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **NumPy**:\n",
    "    The foundation of modern data science.\n",
    "    We will see vectorial computing and the computer memory layout\n",
    "    that allows for fast computations on several numbers (almost) at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Matplotlib**:\n",
    "    For plotting we will see the classical, if not a bit old,\n",
    "    graph drawing library.\n",
    "    Matplotlib is clunky at times but its well proven design allows\n",
    "    one to edit every single detail of a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Pandas**:\n",
    "    Data manipulation is more than working with numbers,\n",
    "    and *pandas* is the *de facto* standard for data\n",
    "    manipulation in Python.\n",
    "    We will explore the features of the library most\n",
    "    commonly used in data science.\n",
    "    *Pandas* is huge, and a full coverage alone would\n",

    "    Next we will need to review a bit of mathematics and statistics.\n",
    "    With that covered we can explore some data analytics in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **SciKit Learn and Classification (KNN)**:\n",
    "    *SciKit Learn* is a library that automates the boring parts of machine learning.\n",
    "    Yet, one needs to understand the boring parts before safely automating them away.\n",
    "    We look at how *SciKit* uses conventions and helper functions to perform its job.\n",
    "    In this case we use a small K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification\n",
    "    algorithm to demonstrate *SciKit Learn*'s capabilities.\n",

    "    Regression was the first machine learning set of algorithms,\n",
    "    way before it was called machine learning.\n",
    "    We explore what additions have been recently made to regression algorithms.\n",
    "    Also, we go back to the idea that not all data are numbers\n",

    "    Clustering is a form of finding knowledge in a dataset without\n",
    "    the help of external description for the data points,\n",

    "    of a technique to better visualize the complexity of a dataset.\n",
    "    We also quickly look at multi-fold techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Decision Trees (and Random Forests) and SVMs**:\n",
    "    More powerful algorithms for classification and regression are explored.\n",
    "    Both, Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are very powerful\n",
    "    but have some limitations.\n",
    "    We will explore the good and bad sides of the techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Neural Networks**:\n",
    "    Starting from defining *Online Learning*, we skim over the concepts\n",
    "    of neural networks.\n",
    "    *Neural Networks* (NNs) are a very big topic with several books on.\n",
    "    Our interest here is their comparison with the other techniques\n",
    "    we saw, and a reasonable understanding of their training and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Extras and the future**:\n",
    "    We give resources for future exploration.\n",
    "    Also we attempt to discuss the state of art of machine learning\n",
    "    as of the time of writing.\n",
